    "This course aims to be an introductions for data engineers or software engineers to the Scala programming language. Having some basic programming skills is required. Having Java experience makes things a lot easier because Scala compiles for the Java Virtual Machine aka JVM. Scala compiles into javascript and LLVM (like C) but its outside of the scope of this workshop.\n",
    "The main goal of this course is to set the foundations to use scala in big data projects like Apache Spark and Akka Streams using a \"professional\" software engineer practices and cloud services. Think it like \"how the big companies solve big data problems\"."

    "As many other programmers, i came to scala seeking for a better tool to make UDF in Apache Spark (thank to the weird implementation of scala 2.0 in java). After a couples of minutes playing in the spark-shell i make it one of my dearest frinds.\n",
    "The big charm of scala (imho) are 2 things: the java ecosystem (library for everything!) and the functional language capabilities.\n",
    "Working in a functional way make a lot easier to think about distributed systems and realiability. The natural separation of the IO operations from computing, make things alot easier to test and debug. Only remember 1 time that i need the debugger in 6 years using scala (and was for oop code).\n",
