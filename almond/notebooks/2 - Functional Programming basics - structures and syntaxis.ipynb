    "# Functional programming\n",
    "Functional programming is a paradigm design to process lists and uses matematical functions to do that.\n",
    "If you come from procedural or object-oriented languages, came to mind limitations that are a little awkward at first and is totally normal. For me, embracing a \"functional\" style is process that takes times and effort: is like playing the same tetris game but with diffent figures!\n",
    "One of the nices things about scala is that you could walk at you own pace: it's no shame in keep using class, var and for!\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, the object-oriented paradign is like building little actors, teach them to do some cool tricks and coordinate them to play a show. In the other side, the functional paradigm is like building some \"chain production lines\" where the raw materials are transformed and combined to produce something: it's all about types and the relationships (or functions) between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scala implementation of functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala is a \"impure\" functional language because support other paradigms. This implies that the \"limitations\" of the functional paradigm could be broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional paradigm strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpler to read and reason about.\n",
    "- Errors are first class citizens.\n",
    "- When somethings breaks there almost no chances that the system will become \"stuck\" in a \"weird\" state.\n",
    "- Makes simple to reason about parallelism and distributed systems. Passing from single-thread to multi-thread processing just adding `.par`.\n",
    "- Testing is easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function paradigm weakness\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is not optimize for \"turing\" machines. Usually ends up using more memory han other paradigms.\n",
    "- Almost all the terms comes from \"category theory\", so the vocabulary is challenging.\n",
    "- (A lot) slower that other paradigms in systems that use mutable states.\n",
    "- Its hard to \"re learn\" to program."
